# Went Hiking

Went Hiking is a kickass way to keep track of your trips into the wilderness, record your thoughts, and save your photos. We aim to be the easiest way to share your trips and discover new ones in your area. The end goal is to have a crowd-sourced database of hikes and experieces to elevate the level of hiking resource websites.
