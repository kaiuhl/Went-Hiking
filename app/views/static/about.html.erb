	<h2>What is this all about anyway?</h2>
	<p><a href="http://wenthiking.com">Went Hiking</a> is a kickass way to keep track of your trips into the wilderness, record your thoughts, and save your photos.

	<h2>The Origin Story</h2>

	<p><a href="http://wenthiking.com">Went Hiking</a> was created by me, <a href="http://kaiuhl.com/">Kyle Meyer</a>, for my own personal use. I have a full-time job as a web designer <span class="amp">&amp;</span> developer, but take every opportunity to get outside and backpack. Last year, I started keeping track of my trips in a spreadsheet to see what my cumulative statistics were, mostly for fun.</p>

	<p>Early in 2011, I decided I could do better than a spreadsheet. I whipped up a really rough version of this site, and posted it to my local hiking forum, <a href="http://portlandtriprs.org">Portland Triprs</a> to see if anyone else had interest in the tool. I've since made revisions based on their feedback, and while it's still not nearly complete, it is now a reliable tool for the simple logging of trips and sharing them with others.</p>
